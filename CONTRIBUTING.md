### Code Contributions

#### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Click 'Fork' on GitHub, then:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FirePrint-v1.0.git
   cd FirePrint-v1.0
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # Development dependencies
   ```

4. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

#### Development Workflow

1. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
   - Add docstrings to functions and classes
   - Comment complex logic

2. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   pytest tests/
   
   # Check code style
   flake8 src/
   
   # Check type hints
   mypy src/
   ```

3. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
   ```
   
   Commit message format:
   - `feat: add new feature`
   - `fix: fix bug in component`
   - `docs: update documentation`
   - `refactor: refactor code`
   - `test: add tests`

4. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Go to your fork on GitHub
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Fill in the PR template
   - Link related issues

#### Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guide
- Use type hints for function parameters and returns
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write docstrings in Google or NumPy format

Example:
```python
def polygon_to_fingerprint(
    geometry: Polygon,
    image_size: int = 224,
    debug: bool = False
) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Convert fire polygon to 4-channel fingerprint image.
    
    Args:
        geometry: Shapely polygon representing fire boundary
        image_size: Output image dimension (default: 224)
        debug: Whether to show debug visualizations
        
    Returns:
        NumPy array of shape (image_size, image_size, 4)
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If geometry is invalid or empty
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

#### Testing

- Write unit tests for new features
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use pytest fixtures for common test data

```python
import pytest
from src.polygon_converter import polygon_to_fingerprint

def test_polygon_to_fingerprint_basic():
    """Test basic polygon conversion."""
    # Test implementation
    pass

def test_polygon_to_fingerprint_invalid_input():
    """Test error handling for invalid input."""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        polygon_to_fingerprint(None)
```
