### Performance Metrics

- Classification accuracy: 85%+ across all tasks
- Processing speed: 100 fires/second
- Model size: ~50MB
- Search latency: <1 second
- Feature extraction: 200 fires/minute
- CNN inference: 500 fires/minute

### Dataset

- Australian Bushfire Boundaries Historical Dataset 2024 V3
- 324,741 fire polygons (1898-2024)
- Complete metadata: type, cause, location, size, date

### Known Limitations

- Large dataset processing requires significant memory (16GB+ RAM)
- GPU recommended for training (tested on NVIDIA RTX 3080)
- Some notebooks may need adjustment for different environments
- Full dataset processing can take 4-6 hours

### Technical Stack

- Python 3.9+
- TensorFlow 2.13+
- GeoPandas 0.14+
- OpenCV 4.8+
- Scikit-learn 1.3+
- NumPy 1.24+ (< 2.0 due to compatibility)
