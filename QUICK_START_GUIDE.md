# 🚀 FirePrint - Quick Start Guide

## ⚡ 5-Minute Understanding

### What is FirePrint?
**FirePrint converts fire boundary shapes into images and uses AI to analyze fire patterns.**

### Like Your RIP Project:
| Your RIP Project | FirePrint Project |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| 📹 Input: Beach video | 🔥 Input: Fire boundary shapes |
| 🤖 Process: CNN detects patterns | 🤖 Process: Convert to images → CNN analyzes |
| 🎯 Output: Video with rips marked | 🎯 Output: Fire classification + similar fire search |

### Real Use Case Example:
```
🔥 NEW BUSHFIRE OCCURS
   ↓
🖼️ Fire boundary shape captured by satellite
   ↓
🔍 System processes:
   • Converts shape to 4-channel "fingerprint" image
   • CNN classifies: "Bushfire, Lightning cause, High complexity"
   • Searches database: Finds 5 similar historical fires
   ↓
👨‍🚒 Fire investigator sees:
   "This pattern similar to 2009, 2015, 2020 fires
    All were lightning-caused, spread rapidly due to wind"
   ↓
✅ Better response planning and resource allocation
```

## 🎯 Most Important Code (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Convert a Fire to Fingerprint:
```python
from polygon_to_fingerprint import polygon_to_fingerprint

# Your fire polygon (from shapely)
fire_polygon = Polygon([(x1,y1), (x2,y2), ...])

# Convert to fingerprint
fingerprint = polygon_to_fingerprint(fire_polygon)
# Result: 224×224×4 numpy array
```

### Extract Features:
```python
from fire_pattern_analyzer import FirePatternAnalyzer

analyzer = FirePatternAnalyzer()
features = analyzer.extract_all_features(fingerprint)
# Result: Dictionary with 23 features
```

### Find Similar Fires:
```python
from fire_similarity_search import FireSimilaritySearch

search_engine = FireSimilaritySearch()
search_engine.load_database()
search_engine.build_search_engine('combined')

similar = search_engine.find_similar_fires(query_index=0, n_neighbors=5)
# Result: 5 most similar fires with distances
```

### Full Pipeline:
```python
# 1. Load system
system = FireFingerprintingSystem()
system.load_demo_data()

# 2. For new fire:
fingerprint = polygon_to_fingerprint(new_fire_polygon)

# 3. Classify:
predictions = model.predict(fingerprint)
fire_type = predictions[0]        # Fire type
cause = predictions[1]             # Ignition cause
state = predictions[2]             # State
size_category = predictions[3]    # Size category

# 4. Find similar:
similar_fires = search_engine.find_similar_fires(...)
```

## 💡 Remember

**FirePrint is like your RIP project, but instead of:**
- Video frames → Detect rip currents
**It does:**
- Fire polygons → Classify fire characteristics → Find similar fires

**Both use computer vision to solve real-world problems!**
