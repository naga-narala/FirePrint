# 🔥 Fire Fingerprinting with Computer Vision

A novel computer vision system that converts Australian bushfire polygon boundaries into "fingerprint" images and uses CNNs to classify fire patterns - **first of its kind in fire science!**

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project transforms geospatial fire boundary data into standardized visual representations (fingerprints) that can be analyzed using deep learning techniques. Each fire polygon is converted into a 4-channel image containing:

1. **Shape Mask** - Binary representation of fire boundary
2. **Distance Transform** - Spatial complexity patterns
3. **Boundary Curvature** - Edge complexity analysis
4. **Fractal Dimension** - Self-similarity patterns

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: Australian Bushfire Boundaries Historical Dataset 2024 V3
- **Records**: 324,741 fire polygons (1898-2024)
- **Labels**: fire_type, ignition_cause, state, area_ha, ignition_date
- **Format**: ESRI Geodatabase (.gdb)

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Generate Fire Fingerprints**
   ```python
   from src.polygon_converter import polygon_to_fingerprint
   from src.data_processor import process_fire_dataset
   
   # Process sample dataset
   fingerprints, labels, metadata = process_fire_dataset(
       "data/Bushfire_Boundaries_Historical_2024_V3.gdb", 
       sample_size=1000
   )
   ```

3. **Train CNN Model**
   ```python
   from src.trainer import train_fire_cnn
   
   model, history = train_fire_cnn(fingerprints, labels)
   ```
